# Windows 10 settings initializer
This script sets the settings for a freshly installed Windows 10 for the current user. Some settings are applied to future users by storing them in the template hive. Not all of them work on new users because some settings are applied when creating a user for the first time.
## Reason for this script
It optimizes the usage of Windows 10 by disabling animations, setting the explorer to the old folder structure and doing a lot of desktop tweaking. This should be used by uses who want their desktop optimized.

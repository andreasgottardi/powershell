# Replace byte value

This script should be seen as an example on how to change the value of a specific byte in a file with PowerShell. It takes the shortcut to the PowerShell window and replaces the byte value "0xE" (decimal 14) with "0x10" (decimal 16). This is done to increase the default font size when opening PowerShell. Of course, all other ocurrences of the value "0xE" also get changes. So this is not a practical method to change the font size and other byte patterns must be checked.

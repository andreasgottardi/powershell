# Work in progress: DotNet installer

This is an un-/installer for the .NET core SDK for automated installation and uninstallation of the framework. There are a few open points that have to be clearified before this installer is completed:

* Shall all the previous versions get uninstalled or just specific ones?
* How to handle non core versions?

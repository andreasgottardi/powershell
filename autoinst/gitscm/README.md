# Git SCM installer

The "gitscm" folder contains the installer scripts for Git on Windows operating systems. It automatically downloads and installs the Git bash and gui and makes the program available via right click menue. The ps1 files ask for administrator permissions themselfs, if not already granted. Easiest way to install is right click on "update.bat" and "Run as administrator".

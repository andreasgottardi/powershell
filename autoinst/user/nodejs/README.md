# Node.js installer

Installs the current LTS version of Node.js into the users local appdata directory. Additionally the path variable is set to enable calling the command "node" and "npm" from everywhere in the system. Uninstaller removes all installations and removes every occurence of the string "NodeJS" from the path environment.
